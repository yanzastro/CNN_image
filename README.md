# clustermass_cnn
This repository includes codes defining the architecture of Convolutional Neural Network used in my paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11819

The network is primarily used to estimate galaxy cluster masses from images, but can be generalized to other tasks (some modification is needed to match the size of input and output)
